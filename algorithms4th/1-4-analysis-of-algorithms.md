## 术语卡——Scientific method
- **术语**：scientific method
- **印象**：The very same approach that scientists use to understand the natural world is effective for studying the running time of programs:
	- **Observe** some feature of the nature world, generally with precise measurements.
	- **Hypothesize** a model that is consistent with the observation.
	- **Predict** events using the hypothesis.
	- **Verify** the predictions by making further observations.
	- **Validate** by repeating until the hypothesis and observation agree.
- **出处**： 《Algorithms 4th》

## 术语卡——Mathematical models
- **术语**： Mathematical models
- **印象**：Knuth’s basic insight is simple: **the total running of a program is determined by two primary factors:**
	- The cost of executing each statement.
	- The frequency of execution of each statement.
- **例子**： The former is a property of the computer, the Java compiler and the operating system; the latter is a property of the program and the input.
