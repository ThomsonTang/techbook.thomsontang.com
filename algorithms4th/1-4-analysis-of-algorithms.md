## 术语卡——Scientific method
- **术语**：scientific method
- **印象**：The very same approach that scientists use to understand the natural world is effective for studying the running time of programs:
	- **Observe** some feature of the nature world, generally with precise measurements.
	- **Hypothesize** a model that is consistent with the observation.
	- **Predict** events using the hypothesis.
	- **Verify** the predictions by making further observations.
	- **Validate** by repeating until the hypothesis and observation agree.
