> Design Principle
> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

Another way to think about this principle:
**take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don’t.**

## 金句卡
- Change is constant.
- Java interfaces have no implementation code, so no code reuse.
